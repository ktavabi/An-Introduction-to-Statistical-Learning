## Debugging a learning algorithm

![alt text](image.png)

You've implemented regularized linear regression on housing prices: $J (w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sigma{i=1}{m}(f*{})
1
:
2m.
i=1
But it makes unacceptably large errors in predictions. What do you try next?
→ Get more training examples
→ Try smaller sets of features x, x2, *,\_,›...
→ Try getting additional features
→ Try adding polynomial features (x}, x2, x1X2, etc)
→ Try decreasing 2
→ Try increasing 2
